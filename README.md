Annotations for the Meta-Evaluation of Machine Translation Research
=============

The annotations are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C4kYnnKbIn2U_zEWsLGkReUzb-HqGxN4cQqje4uojmE).


These annotations were used to conduct a meta-evaluation of machine translation publications published from 2010 to 2020 at conferences organized by the ACL. The analysis of this meta-evaluation, including pitfalls and concerning trends, is presented in the following publication: "Scientific Credibility of Machine Translation Research: A Meta-Evaluation of 769 Papers" by Benjamin Marie, Atsushi Fujita, and Raphael Rubino (ACL2021).

The annotations will be updated to include upcoming conferences and keep track of the evolution of the machine translation evaluation.
